This repository contains a simple Java program demonstrating a common off-by-one error when accessing array elements. The `BuggyArrayAccess.java` file shows the erroneous code that attempts to access an index beyond the array's bounds, resulting in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The corrected version, `FixedArrayAccess.java`, illustrates how to fix this error by adjusting the loop condition to prevent accessing the invalid index.
